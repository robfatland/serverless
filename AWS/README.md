# Overview

Serverless computing on AWS uses **AWS Lambda**. A lambda function can do a lot of different things including

* Monitor your spend rate on the cloud and notify you every day by email
* Turn an EC2 instance on and off every day to reduce the cost of operating it
* Respond to a web request with data or the results of a calculation

The sub-folders of this folder address some of these tasks.

(kilroy) This would benefit from a transfer out of `costnotify` and from `Zero2API`.
