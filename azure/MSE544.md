# Azure Functions: Serverless computing on the cloud

> This tutorial follows a very minimalist path to a working example of serverless,
owing to time constraints. We suggest viewing this as introductory steps towards 
developing comprehensive cloud computing 'builder' skills.

## Overview

[TOC](#table-of-contents)


This section looks at cloud thinking, cloud terminology and the road ahead. 


> Working on the cloud: Things like storage or containers or a virtual machine or an Azure Function are
> generically called **Resources**. One thing to be on the lookout for are various types of virtual boxes
> that *contain* resources; an organization mechanism. You have seen this already with Resource Groups and
> perhaps Storage Accounts. 



* Serverless computing is an important element of computing on the cloud
    * The goal is to build some simple compute functionality on the (Azure) cloud without bothering with a server
    * A server is a computer that listens for traffic and responds; it requires care and feeding
    * If we succeed: We get to skip the care and feeding part. This is '*serverless*.'
    * The serverless brand name is '**Azure Function**'. On AWS it is '**Lambda Function**'
    * Advantages: **Low hassle, Secure, Scalable, $Cheap**
    * A serverless function requires a **trigger** to start it in motion
        * Example triggers: An automated 'computer alarm clock', an HTTP web request
    * We want to notice how system feedback helps us debug
    * Serverless functions tend to do *simpler* tasks compared to what we do with *containers*


* Milestones
    - From a browser: Use the Azure Portal to create an Azure Function App
    - Configure your personal computer to be a Development Environment (already done!)
    - Build and test an Azure Function on your computer
    - Push that to the cloud and test it there


### Azure


[TOC](#table-of-contents)


* Microsoft Azure is one of the primary public clouds
    * We develop cloud content locally in **Visual Studio Code** or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Jargon: *Scalable* means that the cloud can handle large demand for this content
    * ...typically by making lots of copies of the execution environment
* Jargon: *Azure Function App* is an execution context for one or more Azure Functions
    - This is an organizing box
    - The 'Function App' can be viewed as 'An App With multiple moving parts (Functions) working together'
    - Our emphasis is more on getting a Function working; so Function App is a 'box for functions'
* Jargon: *Stateless* means that the Azure Function runs with no memory of what has happened in the past


> An **Azure Function** runs in a *one-time transaction* model; '*stateless*' (no memory of past runs) 
> However: An Azure Function can connect to persistent storage (say a database or object storage) which
> starts to look like a *state*. 


> Azure also provides an explicitly *stateful* version of Functions
> called '**Durable Functions**'.



### VSCode


**VSCode** application contains many **views** (information panels) that we manage.


- **`EXPLORER`** view shows files in a folder
- **`RUN AND DEBUG`** view 
- **`EXTENSIONS`** view 
- **`AZURE`** view shows a **`RESOURCES`** list and a **`WORKSPACE`** (sub-views)
- **`DOCKER`** view 


When the view we need is not visible: We change the view. The view selector is the vertical strip
of icons on the left edge of the VSCode application window. This is called the **Activity Bar**
and each icon toggles its corresponding view.



> A possible point of confusion: We use the term 'serverless' for Azure Functions:
> Azure handles the computer host for us. **However** in the course of developing the Function 
> on our own laptop: We *do* need a computer host (*server*). What is that server? That server 
> *is* your laptop running a little server program, pretending to be a server in the cloud. 
> VSCode will provide a URL that starts with **`http://localhost`**: That will be the connection 
> to your local server.


### Additional details in passing


* __init__.py is the Python *recipe* for the Azure Function. The example code has four components.
* Security: The walkthrough uses *Anonymous* meaning anyone can use the Azure Function service
    * Security is outside the scope of this introduction
    * ...but it is absolutely essential to building reliable stuff on the cloud
        * Example: Code (like this walkthrough) that goes on GitHub must not contain sensitive info
        * ...so we store that sensitive stuff on the cloud...
        * ...and the code reads it in only when it is needed
* The `requirements.txt` file lists libraries needed by a particular Python program
* We are using Python 3.9 64-bit
* HTTP has 9 request methods, of which we care about two: GET and POST
    * GET is simpler and less secure than HTTP POST... I wonder which one we are using!
    * `.text`; body parse; logging and bindings
    * HTTP reply back response; which we parse using our browser / eyes; or using Python code
    * The HTTP request is the *trigger* for the Azure Function (one trigger per Function)
* Debugging skills are extremely important; and a diagnostic print statement is a key debugging tool
    * In this walkthrough: Be on the lookout for how to use a print statement in this manner
* Debugging an error message: Sometimes but not always a browser can help
    * An example browser search: **`vscode azure function <error message>`**. 


### Serverless: What is it good for?


> Suppose you start harvesting data from a remote sensing company ('Planet' for example: 
> They operate about 150 satellites, each generating images of the earth's surface in
> high resolution; 350 million square kilometers of color imagery per day... 3 meter pixels) 
> Suppose you are interested in flower blooms on alpine
> meadows; or crop growth and harvest patterns; or changes in glacier flow speed; or flooding across the Amazon
> basin. You write code to do this analysis working from some example datasets; but once that code is 
> working: How would you scale up your processing to 
> match the volume of data being generated by Planet? One answer: When the grand task can be broken down into 
> small sub-tasks it might be a candidate for serverless computing by means of 
> *serverless functions*; which are small, simple processing modules. They
> can be plugged together like legos to create a 
> workflow that operates automatically and cheaply at large scale.
> Serverless functions have other uses as well; generally in relation to high-volume,
> lightweight-task scenarios. 


## 1 Establish access to an Azure Subscription 


[TOC](#table-of-contents)


* Log in to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) to verify your access
    * You authenticate using your UW NetID


> There are points in building computing infrastructure where we use authentication strings
> to allow resources to work together. Be on the alert for the ways that authentication strings
> can be saved and used securely, without risk of an unauthorized party copying and using them.
> This idea is central to building *secure* systems on the public cloud. This is obviously
> important for commercial / financial systems; but it is equally important for example 
> in the context of medical research involving patient data. 


## 2 Portal work


[TOC](#table-of-contents)


- Examine the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) upper left corner 


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/serverless/blob/main/azure/images/AzureFunctions_001_portal.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>


> The top row of icons includes...
> - **Create a resource** is the starting point for manually getting cloud resources, also called *services*. 
> - **Resource group** (abbreviated 'RG') is a virtual container (think 'project box') for related resources we use to build something with
> - **Subscription** is a User account; it can contain many RGs
> - **Marketplace** is a catalog of cloud resources
> - **Storage account** is another organizing box: Specifically for containing various types of data storage
> - **Azure Active Directory** is a tool for managing access and authentication
> - **Virtual Machines** are computers: A specific and commonly used type of resource


- Type 'function' in the top search window to find **`Azure Function App`** (the execution context for Azure Functions)


<BR>
<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/serverless/blob/main/azure/images/AzureFunctions_002_CreateFunctionAppButton.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
<BR>


- Select Function App
- Click on the **Create** button to launch a *create* wizard

<BR><BR>

> You can **`Delete`** this Function App whenever you like. (Don't just yet: We need it.) 
> When you Delete a Resource: You stop paying for it. Resources we start and then forget about -- that continue
> to cost money without serving any purpose -- are called cloud zombies. 


    
<BR><BR>    
<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/serverless/blob/main/azure/images/AzureFunctions_003_CreateFunctionAppWizard1.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
<BR><BR>    

    

- Using your own NetID to personalize: Configure the first 'Basic' tab of the Wizard as above
    - Assign the Function App to your Resource Group and be sure to select Python, version 3.9, and West US 2
- Click **Review + create** (this skips the other tabs)
- Click **Create**

    
<BR><BR>

> This procedure (jumping to Review + create) skips intermediate tabs: Storage, Networking, Monitoring, Deployment, Tags.
> Each has a relevance to how the Azure Function App works. 
> To refine your skills: Dig in to these tabs at a later time to build a more complete understanding of all the component parts. 
> As one example: **Tagging** attaches key-value pairs that you define to the Function App. 
> Tags can be invaluable reminders for you and others about what the Function App is doing. 

<BR><BR>
    
- Verify you get this confirmation message:

    
<BR><BR>
<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/serverless/blob/main/azure/images/AzureFunctions_005_FunctionAppDeployment.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
<BR><BR>
   

- To see more on this Azure Function App: Click **Go to resource**.

    
<BR><BR>
<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/serverless/blob/main/azure/images/AzureFunctions_006_FunctionAppOverview.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
<BR><BR>
   

- Please note these details within this view
    - The upper left corner link returns to the Home view
    - The left sidebar title is the name of your Azure Function App: Your portal view focus
    - The scrollable left side-bar is a context menu for the many facets of the Azure Function App
        - By default *Overview* is selected: What we see in the main-central panel
    - Along the top of the main-center panels find a series of common tasks
        - **Browse**, **Refresh**, **Stop**, **Restart**, **Delete** etc
        - The Azure Function App can be turned on and off (without deleting it)
    - Right side of main panel: A URL associated with the Azure Function App

    
<BR>
<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/serverless/blob/main/azure/images/AzureFunctions_007_AzureFunctionAppURL.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
<BR>

    
- Paste the URL to a new browser tab to view the simple placeholder Azure Function App (below)
    - This App features a little interactivity (click the little smiley face)
- Return to the Azure Function App and navigate to **Functions** (left sidebar): No Functions are listed
    - + Create provides 3 options: VSCode, editor + Core Tools, or Develop in portal
        - You might try options 2 or 3 as a stretch goal; here we now proceed to use VSCode


## 3 On templates and code

    
[TOC](#table-of-contents)

    
> In the portal Overview view of this Azure Function App: Notice the **JSON view** link
at the upper right. Click this link to see a pop-up
text document that describes the Azure Function using a descriptive
protocol called JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). This JSON text can be used as a template
to create new Azure Function Apps, i.e. using code rather than manually. This is the 
doorway to doing your cloud-based construction from code rather than clicking on wizards.


    
## 4 Switching to Visual Studio Code (VSCode)


[TOC](#table-of-contents)


- Start **VSCode** and ensure (bottom info bar) you are logged in to Azure
- If not done already: Use the Extensions view to find and install the **Azure Functions** extension
- It often helps to stop and re-start VSCode to cause changes to take effect
 

## 5 Installing Python and related libraries

 
[TOC](#table-of-contents)
    
    
- Install Python 3.9 64-bit with defaults
    - ***VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! DO NOT SELECT "Add Python to PATH"***'
    - Stop and re-start VSCode and open the command palette with ctrl+shift+p
    - Verify Python 3.9 64-bit in bash: `python --version`
    - Update `pip`: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
 - Install [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)
 
 
> Notes: 
> - `requests` library should not be necessary.  (Facilitates the Python test in section 10.)
> - Mac Users may have issues...
>     - ...M1 processor
>     - ...[**.Net Core**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)


## 6 Creating an Azure Function in VSCode

    - Use ctrl + shift + p to bring up command options
    - Choose **`Python: Select interpreter`**
    - Choose Python 3.9
- The VSCode console layout includes an **Activity Bar** at the extreme left (vertical sequence of icons)
    - Also on the left side of VSCode is a second **Sidebar** with one or more information panels
    - Your **Activity Bar** selection will determine the view in the **Sidebar**.
- At the bottom of the VSCode console is a status bar. 
    - Select the Azure icon in the Activity Bar
    - You should see your Azure sign-in status in the status bar: `Azure:yourNetID@uw.edu`*
    - If you are not signed in to Azure 
        - ctrl + shift + p to bring up the command options 
        - Type `Azure Sign In` at the prompt and select this option 
        - Authenticate and verify the status bar

    
<BR><BR>
> While you are authenticated into Azure, the VSCode app is running on your laptop; 
> so there is a 'here' and a 'there'. 'Here' is your laptop VSCode app and 'there' is 
> the Azure cloud. 
<BR><BR>
    
    
- Use ctrl + j to bring up a tabbed console in the lower part of the VSCode main window.
- Toggle on the Azure icon in the activity bar. 
    - Note the RESOURCES and WORKSPACE panels in the sidebar

## 7 Code break
    

[TOC](#table-of-contents)


- Above: Explorer view shows the project files for the Azure Function `azurefunction`
    - Next is to modify the code that runs when `azurefunction` is triggered
        - We will permit two options: One to factor an integer, one to solve a Sudoku puzzle
        - These will correspond to keys `n` and `s` respectively
- In the file `__init__.py` replace the default code with the following: 
 


```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
    
def factor_integer(n):
    if n < 4: return [n]
    prime_factors, factor_candidate = [], 2
    while factor_candidate ** 2 <= n:                        # regime of possible factors
        if n % factor_candidate:                             # non-divisible: remainder evaluates as True
            if factor_candidate == 2: factor_candidate = 3   # increase candidate factor
            else:                     factor_candidate += 2  # ...not efficient!...
        else:
            n = n / factor_candidate                 # reduce n by this factor
            prime_factors.append(factor_candidate)   
    if n > 1: prime_factors.append(int(n))           # final factor (unless it is 1)
    return prime_factors

    
def sudoku_solver(p):
    i = p.find('0')
    if i < 0: yield p
    else:
        for v in set('123456789')-set(p[j] for j in range(81)
            if (i%9==j%9) or (i//9==j//9) or (i//27==j//27 and i%9//3==j%9//3)):
            for s in sudoku_solver(p[:i]+v+p[i+1:]): yield s
             

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info('Just imagine! An HTTP trigger ran this Azure Function!')
    n = req.params.get('n')
    s = req.params.get('s')
    if n:
        factor_list = factor_integer(int(n))      # gets a list of factors
        factor_string = ' * '.join([str(f) for f in factor_list])
        reply_string = 'Results: ' + str(n) + ' has ' + str(len(factor_list)) + ' factors, is = ' \
                       + factor_string + ' ... thanks for playing!'
    elif s:
        if len(s) == 81 and s.isnumeric():
            reply_string = ''
            for solution_string in sudoku_solver(s): reply_string += solution_string + '\n'
        else: reply_string = 'could not parse Sudoku puzzle string'
    else: reply_string = "no parameter parsed"

    return func.HttpResponse(reply_string, status_code = 200)
```

* Save this new version of `__init__.py`
    * Optional: Read through the code to decode what it does
 
 
# MSE544 students: Problems with the next steps?
 
 
Try the local test steps below. If this is is not working: You can try to debug. However if you are 
unable to make progress: No worries. Simply *read through* the
[remainder of section 7](#the-remainder-of-section-7(
as well as 
[section 8](#8-test-locally)
and then proceed to follow the steps in
[Section 9](#9-deploy-to-azure). 

 
## the remainder of section 7
 
* From the VSCode **`Run`** menu: Start the debugger
    * You may need to confirm that you trust the publisher (you)
    * This will launch this Azure Function locally on your laptop
        * Your laptop is running a Server on behalf of this Azure Function
    * Upon finishing the build: 
        * VSCode tends to put your tabbed console in `DEBUG CONSOLE` mode
        * Switch it to `TERMINAL` view
        * Here you should see some messages including a URL
            * For example: **`http://localhost:7071/api/azurefunction`**
            * `localhost` is your computer. 
            * `7071` is a **port** or a *dedicated communication channel*. 
        * Copy-paste this URL from VSCode into your browser address bar
        * This should result in the message `no parameter parsed`
* VSCode will stay in Debug *run* mode until you stop it

    
> The code in the Python file **`__init__.py`** consists of four sections:
> - import libraries
> - a function **`factor_integer()`**: factors an integer into prime factors
> - a function **`sudoku_solver`**: solves a Sudoku puzzle
> - main: receive the HTTP request and responds to it

    
## 8 Test locally

    
[TOC](#table-of-contents)

    
* As directed in section 7 above: Run your Azure function by starting the VSCode debugger
    * Paste the URL this gives in your browser
    * To start with give no parameters; result should be `no parameter parsed`
* add the parameter at the end of the URL: `?n=60`
* change this parameter to `?s=027800061040030008910005420500016030000970200070000096700000080006027000030480007`
    
    
When using the parameter key 'n' the Azure Function interprets the request as 'factor this integer value'. 
The key 's' is interpreted as 'solve this Sudoku puzzle'. The puzzle consists of a string of 81 digits.
A zero digit means that square begins as blank. When the solver is successful: All the zeros are replaced
by other digits.

- While the debugger is still running (the local Azure Function is available)...
    - Return to the code editor for the Python file `__init__.py`
    - Click to the left of line 5 of this file to set an execution break point
        - This is a red dot
    - Place the Function URL in your browser again: With a new value of the parameter `n` like: **`?n=1234`**
    - Hit Enter and notice that VSCode comes up...
        - The code has stopped running at line 5; see screencap below
    - Hover over the variable `n` with your cursor to verify that it has value `1234`

- Place your cursor inside the **`WORKSPACE`** panel and select **`Deploy...`** (icon above)
    - Select **`Deploy to Function App`**
    - Select the folder for your Azure Function
    - Select the Azure Function App built earlier via the portal
    - Confirm the Deploy action
    - Note the publication URL and paste this into a browser address bar
        - In this example: [**`https://rob5-function-app.azurewebsites.net/api/azurefunction`**](https://rob5-function-app.azurewebsites.net/api/azurefunction)
    - Test the Azure Function using the factoring (`?n=2342`) and Sudoku tests as above

  
<BR><BR>    
> The deployment will enable Application Insights by default. 
This is a service that gives us access to logging results
in the console. 
<BR><BR>    
  
> We can go to the Azure portal (web browser) 
to confirm the Azure Function appears in the Azure Function App.

## 10 Programmatic test


[TOC](#table-of-contents)


> Next we trigger the Azure Function we just built using Python. 
This is only about four lines of code; and it demonstrates again
the transition from manual actions to automation. 
    
    
```
import requests
urlbase='https://rob5-function-app.azurewebsites.net/api/azurefunction'
full_url = urlbase + '?n=23948'
print(requests.get(full_url).text)
```

> Notice the code above is specific to my names for both the *Azure Function App*
> and the *Azure Function*. The Python code tests the cloud version of the Azure Function. 
> You can also test your 
> local-machine version of the Azure Function with the same Python code; just
> by modifying `urlbase` to something like `http://localhost:7071/azurefunction`.

    
- Start the Python interpreter by typing `python` at the command prompt
    - The Python prompt is `>>> ` 
- Copy-paste the code above one line at a time
    - After you test `n=23948` you can also test the Sudoku solver
- Stop Python interpreter by typing `exit()`.

    
<BR>
<BR>
> You can also save this code as `test.py` and run it using `% python test.py`

### Data connections    


[TOC](#table-of-contents)
 
 
Azure Functions often involve connecting 
a serverless function to a data resources. While this is 
beyond the scope of this tutorial, instructional materials are 
easy to find on YouTube. A reasonable project would be to construct a small table
of key-value pairs in a NoSQL serverless database 
(on Azure this service is called **`CosmosDB`**) and use an Azure Function to
retrieve data from that table based on an HTTP request ('see stretch problem 2').



### Logging results in the Azure console

    
[TOC](#table-of-contents)
    
    
- Azure portal Home view: Choose the Function App of interest
    - This gives the Overview view by default: see the emphasis on left menu bar
- Choose Functions from this menu bar to list the function `HttpTrigger1` (or whatever it is named)
- Click on that Trigger; and from the new page, at left, click Monitor
- In the main panel of the portal/console select Logs
    - This brings up a black-background text box
    - Test the Azure Function to see diagnostics printed in this text box
        - Notice that the diagnostics text connects back to the Azure Function code
        - This is a debugging pathway: Your Azure Function can tell you what it thinks is going on.


### Triggers
 
 
[TOC](#table-of-contents)

 
A serverless function has a trigger. In this walk-through the trigger is an HTTP request.
A trigger can be associated with inbound data as well; for example a new data file arriving 
in a storage location. There are also automated alarm clock services on the cloud that can
act as triggers. 


    
### Stretch Problem 1

    
[TOC](#table-of-contents)

    
Goal: Measure Azure Function time-per-task from VSCode. 


- Create a Client program that calls the Azure Function
- Call the Azure Function multiple times: timing the results
- Investigate: What consumes the execution time: The task or the network traffic?

    
#### Create a Client


```
import requests
urlbase='https://rob5.azurewebsites.net/api/azfn1'
print(requests.get(urlbase + '?n=144').text)
```

This can be executed one at a time using the Python command prompt `>>>` or written
into a Python program file, say named `azfunctionclient.py`. You may use VSCode for this
where it is strongly encouraged that you save the file outside the Azure Function folder. 
The procedure is to create a new file, paste in the above code, and save this file 
*as type **Python*** in a new folder, again outside the folder containing the Azure function. 
The reason for this is to keep your test client (that runs on your local machine) distinct from 
code that goes into your Azure Function.


Run the client program in VSCode using the 
*run* button (green triangle) at the upper right. Verify that the program works properly
by looking at the output in the TERMINAL window. 


#### Step 2


Modify the program to run 20 Azure Function calls and print the average time required per call.

- Add the line **`import time`** at the top of the file
    - This provides you with a timing library
- Delete the print statement (line 3 of the original program)
- Add code to run the Azure Function 20 times and determine the average time per call
    - The following code blocks can be added in sequence to accomplish this


*Block 1*
```
toc = time.time()
responses = ''
a = 1
b = 21
```

This sets up the parameters to run the Azure Function 20 times and notes the time. 


*Block 2*
```
for i in range(a, b):
    this_response = requests.get(urlbase + '?n=' + str(i)).text
    reduced_response = this_response.replace("playing!", "").replace("for","").replace("thanks","")
    responses += reduced_response.replace("...","") + '\n'    
```

This loop calls the Azure Function 20 times and gets rid of the "... thanks for playing!" message.


*Block 3*

```
tic = time.time()
elapsed_time = tic - toc
print(responses)
print("time per factorization = " + str(elapsed_time / (b-a)))
```

This notes the time again, creates a time difference and prints the average time per Azure Function call.


#### Step 3

    
If you change the range of parameters (1, 21) to much larger numbers, like (1000001, 1000021)
you have presumably made the factoring challenge more time-consuming: The algorithm has more 
work to do. However it is unclear what part of the Azure Function execution takes up how much 
time: Is it the message passing that is time consuming? Or is it the factorization? Or some
combination. 


We can start to get a handle on this by changing the nature of the task to see if this has 
a significant impact on the time elapsed.  


### Stretch Problem 2

    
[TOC](#table-of-contents)

    
Add a binding to a CosmosDB table with these values:

```
1, banana
2, apple
3, orange
```

Then test with `<base>?i=2` to receive reply `apple`.
