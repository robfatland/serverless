# Azure Functions: Serverless computing on the cloud

This tutorial follows a very minimalist path to a working example of serverless,
owing to time constraints. We suggest viewing this as introductory steps towards 
developing comprehensive cloud computing 'builder' skills.

## The plan


This section looks ahead; to frame where we are going. 


* Goal: Build some compute functionality on the (Azure) cloud without bothering with a server
    * A server is a computer that listens for traffic and responds; it requires some care and feeding
    * If we succeed: We get to skip the care and feeding
* Brand name on Azure for 'serverless', what we are building, is an ***Azure Function***


kilroy distinguish Azure Function from Azure App Service


kilroy capit Function throughout


* Milestone 1: Use the Azure portal to set up a Hello World Azure Function using only a web browser
* Milestone 2: Set up your personal computer as a Developer environment
    * From this environment you build locally, test locally, and then push the resulting Azure Function to the cloud
    * The Azure Function you build here goes a bit beyond a trivial hello world example
* Milestone 3: Test the Azure Function on the cloud and learn about some debugging methods


* Serverless on the cloud (here: Azure Functions): **Low hassle, Secure, Scalable, $Cheap**
* A serverless function on the cloud requires a **trigger** to start it in motion.
    * Example: An alarm clock or an HTTP web request can be triggers
* We want to notice how system feedback helps us debug.
* Serverless functions tend to do *simpler* tasks compared to what we do with *containers*.


### Azure


* Microsoft Azure is one of the primary public clouds. It has many well-designed, proven features.
    * We develop cloud content using a local application called **Visual Studio Code** or just [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Jargon: *Scalable* means that the cloud can handle large demand by making lots of copies of an Azure Function that will run in parallel


Looking ahead to using the **VSCode** application: There are a number of **views** (info panels) that enable
our work. For example there is the **`EXPLORER`** view that shows files in a folder; and there is an
**`AZURE`** view that shows us both a **`RESOURCES`** list and a **`WORKSPACE`** (both sub-views).
When we wind up not seeing the view we need: We have to change the view. 
The view selector is a vertical strip
of icons on the left edge of the VSCode application window.


> A possible point of confusion: We use the term 'serverless' to emphasize the mindset of working
> with Azure Functions: We put together the code and let Azure worry about the computer that it will
> run on. **However** in the course of developing the Function on our own laptop: We *do* need a
> server. What is that server? That server *is* your laptop, running a little server program, 
> pretending to be a server in the cloud. As you go through this tutorial: Be on the lookout for 
> when VSCode gives you a URL to
> try out in your browser. This will start with the word **`localhost`** and that is what connects
> your browser to the little server running on your laptop. 


### Additional themes and jargon


* Azure Function components: A storage account, the code base, some configuration files
* __init__.py is the *recipe* for the Azure Function
* Security: *Anonymous* users do not need to authenticate to use a service
* Python environments exist and are configured here via a file `requirements.txt`
* Windows Python 3.8+ 64-bit PATH, PYTHONPATH: Can be a challenge


kilroy follow that up: What does it mean?



* On HTTP triggers: GET and POST are distinct *types*. Example code has “body parse” component; see the Appendix
* Where can results go? HTTP response, a new file in a Storage Account; or a line appended to an existing file; or a new entry in a database table
* More security: Private environment variables; key vault; etc: How to get code to GitHub safely?
* Debugging: Where does `logging.info` go?



kilroy the above bullets are too arcane to be helpful so fix it
